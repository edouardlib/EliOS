# Architecture
1. MVVM implementation with .xib outsourced from Storyboard (Storyboard only used to implement navigation throw segues).
2. Fa√ßade pattern (DataManager singleton class access throw observables than then could access prefences, local database and web services).
3. Observable pattern from ReactiveX to do none ui tasks.
